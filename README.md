## Hello, People 👋

😄 How are you? My name is Alexandre and I am 19 years old.

📚 I started to study Java on July 2022. I joined a course by Adm&Tec to improve my Java skills while also studying Guanabara's Java Course.

⭐ I got the Scrum fundamentals certification and I am doing some Bootcamps from DIO, rocketseat, and others to get more XP. 💫

🌐 I am interested in HTML5/CSS3 and Front-end world.

🤓 I am looking forward to my first opportunity. Give a look at my repositories. Thank you for reading.
